# SDLC Multi-Agent System — Implementation Plan

## Vision & Overall Goal

This project builds a **multi-agent AI system** that operationalises the full Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) through a suite of specialised Claude-based agents, each embodying a distinct professional role, each equipped with role-specific skills scoped to the TOGAF ADM phases relevant to that role.

The system is designed to assist (and partially automate) the end-to-end journey from market analysis and product ideation through architecture, implementation, deployment, and operational change management — with safety and compliance woven in at every phase as a first-class concern.

## Ontology & Conceptual Framework

### Agents as Role-Bounded Control Systems

Each agent is modelled as a **cybernetic control unit** in the sense of Stafford Beer's Viable System Model: it has a defined purpose, defined inputs and outputs, and defined channels of communication upward (reporting, escalation), downward (direction, feedback), and laterally (peer collaboration). No agent has unbounded authority — every agent operates within a mandate defined by its AGENT.md and enforced by the interaction protocols in its skill files.

The **algedonic channel** — a concept taken directly from VSM — is the fast-path escalation signal that bypasses normal hierarchical processing when time-criticality or risk severity demands immediate response. This is formalised in `framework/algedonic-protocol.md` and referenced in every skill file's `## Algedonic Triggers` section.

### The TOGAF ADM as Workflow Backbone

The **TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM)** provides the phase structure:

| Phase | Focus |
|---|---|
| Preliminary | Framework setup, principles, repository initialisation |
| A — Architecture Vision | Scope, stakeholders, high-level solution concept, safety envelope |
| B — Business Architecture | Business processes, capabilities, motivation, value streams |
| C — Information Systems Architecture | Application + Data architecture (logical) |
| D — Technology Architecture | Concrete technology stack, infrastructure, platform |
| E — Opportunities & Solutions | Implementation candidates, gap analysis, build vs buy |
| F — Migration Planning | Roadmap, sequencing, dependency resolution |
| G — Implementation Governance | Development, testing, deployment oversight |
| H — Architecture Change Management | Change impact assessment, continuous improvement |
| Requirements Management | Cross-phase, continuous — feeds all other phases |

These phases are run in **Agile ADM** cadence: time-boxed Architecture Sprints producing phase artifacts, feeding Delivery Sprints for implementation, with explicit iteration and phase-transition gates. This cadence is fully specified in `framework/agile-adm-cadence.md`.

### Agent Roles and Phase Coverage

Nine agent roles are defined. No agent covers all phases — each has a primary set of phases and a consulting set. The full RACI matrix is in `framework/raci-matrix.md`. Summary:

| Agent | Primary Phases | Consulting Phases |
|---|---|---|
| Sales & Marketing Manager | A | Req-Mgmt |
| Product Owner | Prelim, A, B, H | C, E, Req-Mgmt |
| Solution Architect | A, B, C, H | D, E, Req-Mgmt |
| Software Architect / Principal Engineer | D, E, F, G, H | C, Req-Mgmt |
| DevOps / Platform Engineer | D, E, F, G | — |
| Implementing Developer | G | E, F, Req-Mgmt feedback |
| QA Engineer | E/F (test planning), G | H |
| Project Manager | Prelim, A, E, F, G, H | All (coordination) |
| Chief Safety & Compliance Officer | A, B, C, D, G, H | All (gate reviews) |

### Repository Ownership

Work-repositories are role-owned, version-controlled, and path-governed. No agent writes outside its designated paths. Cross-role artifact transfer occurs through defined handoff events, not ad-hoc file sharing.

| Repository | Owner | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `architecture-repository/` | Solution Architect | Architecture Vision, Business Architecture, App/Data Architecture, principles, ADRs |
| `technology-repository/` | Software Architect/PE | Technology Architecture, implementation plans, coding standards, solutions inventory |
| `project-repository/` | Project Manager | Sprint plans, schedules, decision log, lessons learned, knowledge base |
| `safety-repository/` | CSCO | STAMP/STPA analyses, safety constraints, compliance checklists, incident records |
| `delivery-repository/` | Implementing Developer | Feature branches, PRs (draft and final), unit test reports |
| `qa-repository/` | QA Engineer | Test strategies, test cases, execution reports, defect records |
| `devops-repository/` | DevOps/Platform Engineer | IaC, pipeline definitions, environment configs, deployment records |

### Artifact Retrieval Protocol (Confidence-Threshold)

Every skill that consumes an artifact from another role's repository must apply the following rule:

- **High confidence** that the artifact summary is sufficient to fulfil the current task → use the summary header only (≈200–400 tokens)
- **Confidence below threshold** (detail is needed for correctness, the task involves producing a binding output, or an inconsistency is detected) → retrieve and read the full artifact, log the retrieval reason

This protocol is formalised in `framework/repository-conventions.md`.

### Knowledge Self-Assessment and Clarification Protocol

Every agent must continuously monitor whether it has sufficient knowledge to produce correct outputs. When domain-specific facts about the user's situation are absent from all available artifacts and cannot safely be assumed, the agent raises a **Clarification Request (CQ)** rather than proceeding silently. CQs are:
- Structured, specific, and actionable (not open-ended)
- Routed to the appropriate party (user, PM, or producing agent)
- Tracked as sprint blockers by the PM when `blocking: true`
- Batched by the PM for efficient user interaction

The work suspension and resumption rules, CQ format, routing logic, and skill file requirements are fully specified in `framework/clarification-protocol.md`.

### SDLC Entry Points

The system supports seven engagement entry points, from cold-start (EP-0) to change management (EP-H). Users may bring existing documents, designs, codebases, or change requests, and the system will ingest, validate, and warm-start from that material rather than re-doing work already done. Entry procedures, warm-start artifact production, gap assessment, and the Entry Assessment Report format are specified in `framework/sdlc-entry-points.md`.

### Algedonic Protocol

Certain conditions require bypassing normal communication topology and escalating immediately. The algedonic protocol defines:
- Trigger classification (safety-critical, regulatory breach, timeline collapse, unresolvable inter-agent conflict)
- Escalation targets per trigger class
- Simplified "failsafe" decision structures for short time-horizon situations
- Re-integration into normal topology after algedonic event resolution

### Feedback Loops

Every inter-agent handoff supports a bounded feedback cycle:
- **Maximum two iterations** (initial output + one revision) before escalation to PM
- Feedback is structured (template-based), not free-form prose
- Retrospective feedback (all roles → PM knowledge base → skill/process updates) is a separate, lower-frequency loop triggered at sprint boundaries

## Technology Stack

- **Runtime:** Python 3.11+, Pydantic v2 for all data models, artifact schemas, and event payloads
- **Orchestration:** PydanticAI (primary) — provides agent definition, tool use, and structured output natively; avoids heavy framework lock-in while enabling clean composition
- **LLM backend:** Anthropic Claude API (claude-sonnet-4-6 for primary agents; claude-haiku-4-5 for lightweight routing/summarisation tasks)
- **Workflow graph (if needed for complex multi-agent flows):** LangGraph as an optional layer on top of PydanticAI for stateful multi-step orchestration — to be introduced only when the simpler PydanticAI patterns prove insufficient
- **Version control:** Git (all agent definitions, skill files, framework documents, and work-repository schemas are tracked)
- **Artifact persistence:** File-based work-repositories (git-tracked) per engagement under `engagements/<id>/work-repositories/`
- **Workflow state persistence:** SQLite event store (`engagements/<id>/workflow.db`) — **canonical, git-tracked**; Pydantic-validated, append-only, managed by the `EventStore` class in `src/events/`; YAML projection in `engagements/<id>/workflow-events/` also git-tracked for human readability and PR review; schema managed by Alembic migrations
- **Enterprise architecture persistence:** `enterprise-repository/` (embedded) or external EA system via source adapter; configurable via `enterprise-repository-config.yaml`
- **External source adapters:** Read-only, configured in `external-sources/<source-id>.config.yaml`; supports Confluence, Jira, external Git, SharePoint, and generic REST APIs
- **Target project repository:** Per-engagement pointer to the software project being built; separate git repo; configured in `engagements-config.yaml`; local clone at `engagements/<id>/target-repo/` (.gitignored); delivery-repository/ holds metadata only, not code

## Guiding Principles for Authoring Agent & Skill Files

1. **Every directive in a skill file is a prompt engineering decision.** Write it as you would write a system prompt: precise, unambiguous, testable.
2. **Schemas before skills.** Never author a skill that produces or consumes an artifact whose schema doesn't yet exist.
3. **Artifacts are tailored TOGAF.** Artifact selection and design is a streamlined version of the full TOGAF artifact set and must be well-researched and grounded in the ADM specification.
4. **One accountable agent per artifact per phase.** If two agents could plausibly claim ownership, resolve it in the RACI matrix before proceeding.
5. **Feedback loops must have termination conditions.** Every `## Feedback Loop` section must specify a maximum iteration count and an escalation path.
6. **Algedonic triggers are not optional.** Every skill file must have a `## Algedonic Triggers` section, even if the content is "none identified for this skill" — the explicit absence is itself a design decision.
7. **The summary header is a contract.** The artifact summary format defined in `repository-conventions.md` must be produced faithfully by every skill that generates an artifact. It is the unit of inter-agent communication at normal operating tempo.
8. **Knowledge self-assessment is mandatory before every binding output.** Every skill file must have a `## Knowledge Adequacy Check` section specifying: the domain knowledge required, predictable knowledge gaps for that skill, and the conditions under which a Clarification Request (`CQ`) must be raised rather than an assumption made. Agents must never silently assume facts about the user's specific domain, organisation, or system. Every assumption must be documented in the artifact's `assumptions` field. This is governed by `framework/clarification-protocol.md`.
9. **Engagements may start at any ADM phase.** The system must support users who bring existing artifacts, designs, requirements, or codebases. Every AGENT.md must describe how the agent behaves at each of the seven entry points defined in `framework/sdlc-entry-points.md`. The Project Manager skill `master-agile-adm.md` must implement the full entry assessment procedure including the Engagement Profile and Entry Assessment Report.
